Message Table


The MSGTABLE sample demonstrates how to construct and use a message table
resource in your application.

The sample message table (messages.mc) for the message compiler (MC.EXE)
shows the format of a typical message table source file. The message
table source file contains strings in both English and Japanese. Depending
on what your current language settings are, the correct message strings
will be displayed on the console. Note that some of the entries for each
message are optional but are shown for demonstration purposes. See the
documentation in the tools.hlp file on the message table compiler for more
info on which fields are optional.

The msgtest.exe executable shows how to load the message table DLL, how to
extract the message text from the resource with the FormatMessage API, and
how to decode the various bits in the message identifier. Note that the 
messages.h include file to the executable is created during the make process 
by the message compiler (mc.exe) as it is creating the binary resource file 
from the message table source file.

The makefile demonstrates how to set up your dependancy rules for your
message table source files, output files, and message table DLL.

This sample could be easily modified to link the message table resource
directly into your executable rather than into a stand-alone DLL; there is
no requirement that the message table resouce be located only in a DLL,
though this is the common case.
