II. Development Tools

    The following tools were used to generate this project.

    1. Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or above
    2. Microsoft Windows NT Software Development Kit v4.0
        or above
    3. Active X Template Library (ATL) v1.2 or above
    4. Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0

    These tools will be required to recompile any of the project
    code.

III. ICC/COM Issues (Change since Beta 1.0)

    The structure of the SCardCom (High-level, card specific, vendor
    wrapper) example now comforms to Part 6 of the Interoperability
    specification.  This is a major change in structure since the
    previous release!

    The SCardCOM example shows low-level SCSP calling conventions. The
    example is a "shell" for implementing card specific SCSPs.

    All GUIDS are for Microsoft use only! New GUIDS must be
    generated for all other vendor wrapper class implementations.

IV. File System Issues

    File system functions (Open, Close, etc) will require code to
    generate, handle, and track file handles, etc.. A simple example
    is given using a MFC CMap template class.

    Code is handling 2-byte file ID only for ChangeDir, Delete,
    etc.. BSTRs passed into these functions should be 4 characters
    in length containing the file ID (i.e. '3F00') and will be
    converted internally.
