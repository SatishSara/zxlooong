FAKEMENU: Displays a menu-like window

FAKEMENU demonstrates how an application can display a window that
behaves in a similar manner as a menu.  It also illustrates the use
of the <multimon.h> multiple-monitor compatibility header file to
allow the application to run properly on both multiple-monitor
and single-monitor systems.

Right-click in the window to change its background color
via the fake menu.

KEYWORDS: menu, multiple monitors, AttachThreadInput, SetCapture,
ReleaseCapture, MonitorFromPoint, GetMonitorInfo.
