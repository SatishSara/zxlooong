HTTPAuth

This sample is related to the sockauth sample which
demonstrates the use of the SSPI package to implement the client and 
server side of NTLM authentication over a raw sockets connection.  

This sample demonstrates the use of the SSPI package to implement 
the client side of NTLM authentication when interacting with IIS.

To get the expected results, you should configure your target IIS server
to use NTLM authentication.

Please refer to the HTTPAUTH.HTM file included with this sample for more 
information on the concepts demonstrated in this sample

See also the SDK documentation for the latest information on the Wininet 
APIs which alleviates the need for the programmer to manage the 
socket and SSPI layers of the internet client application.
